<h3>
  Guajira-Coin is a cryptocurrency that can currently only be mined using ESP8266 boards.
</h3>

This cryptocurrency is in development and is based on the basic principles of Bitcoin, with the distinction of having a more eco-friendly approach in terms of energy consumption. The uniqueness of this initiative lies in the fact that its mining process can be performed using microcontrollers, making it more accessible and efficient. In addition to offering the possibility of mining the cryptocurrency, the project facilitates secure transactions and serves as an opportunity to understand the functioning of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.
